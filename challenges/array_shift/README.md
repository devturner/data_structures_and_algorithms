# Insert and shift middle index of array
Code Challenge 02 - Insert and shift an array in middle at index

## Challenge
Add an element to the array without using the built in python methods. Find the middle of the even or odd list accordingly, then while the count is not the middle, add old elements into a new list. Once the middle matches the count, add the new element, change the mid number and go back to adding the old elements to the new list.
