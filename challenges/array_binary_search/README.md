# Insert and shift middle index of array
Code Challenge 03 - Use a binary search to find a key in a list, if there. 

## Challenge
I take the high and low index to get half the mid index and check it the key is either the high or low. If the key is not the high or low, we check if the key is higher or lower than the mid and reset the mid up or down depending. Check again until mid is the key and return that. If mid is not the key at the end, we return -1.
